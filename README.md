Plant Disease Detection using CNN

Overview:
This project is dedicated to the detection of plant diseases, specifically focusing on potatoes, utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). By leveraging the power of AI/ML, we aim to achieve early detection, accurate diagnosis, and real-time monitoring of plant diseases, which are crucial for ensuring healthy crop yield and reducing manual labor through data-driven insights.

Why AI/ML in Plant Disease Detection?
Early Detection & Accurate Diagnosis: Quickly identifies potential outbreaks, preventing widespread disease.
Real-Time Monitoring: Continuously observes crop health, facilitating timely interventions.
Reduced Manual Labor: Minimizes the need for manual inspection, saving time and resources.
Data-Driven Insights: Empowers decision-making with actionable insights derived from accurate data analysis.
Scalability: Easily adapts to different scales of farming operations.
Cost-Efficiency: While initial setup requires investment, it leads to significant savings by optimizing resource use.
Environmental Benefits: Promotes sustainable farming practices by reducing the need for chemical treatments.

Project Components
Introduction:
This project introduces an efficient method for detecting plant diseases using a CNN model, achieving a remarkable accuracy rate of 99% over 30 epochs.

CNN Architecture:
The CNN model is tailored for high accuracy in identifying three classes of potato diseases: Early Blight, Late Blight, and Healthy plants.



Dataset:
We utilized a publicly available dataset from Kaggle, which includes 2,152 files categorized into three classes corresponding to the diseases mentioned above. The dataset can be found here.
